[![FX Transactions CI Tests](https://github.com/aastom/fx-transaction/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/aastom/fx-transaction/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml)

FX Transactions stores how much money received from the
customer in the input currency, and how much is paid to the customer in the output currency.

All transactions need the following details:

1. An identifier
2. A customer ID showing who created the transaction
3. Input amount and currency
4. Output amount and currency
5. Date of transaction

The following three endpoints are available:

1. POST /transactions: create a new transaction
2. GET /transactions: list all transactions in the system
3. GET /transactions/<id>: get the specific transaction by ID
